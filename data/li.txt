Our capacity for empathy is what makes humanity so different from the majority of the animal kingdom.  It can unite us in social structures of mutual compassion.  This is easy to see at the local level, in tribes, churches, and in our communities.  We have to expand our application of empathy to the entire planet.  Its the only way we will be compelled to take responsibility for what is done to the other, and in doing so take responsibility for our collective selves.\r\n\r\nWe are at a crossroads in human development.  I only see two basic structures that could unite the world in a long lasting civilization.  Either we take responsibility for ourselves by caring for the other, or a tyrannical hierarchy of control will take that responsibility by preventing us from hurting the other.

{"body":"&gt;Girls are taught not to compromise their femininity regardless of what they are interested in doing.\n\nSo we're supposed to fight like hell, against our own financial self-interest, to change some social mores, but accept others as insurmountable obstacles that we must work around?\n\nSilly. \n\nWhy doesn't PZ Meyers criticize little girls for buying pink microscopes, instead of toymakers for not releasing the most powerful model in pink (the less powerful ones are available in black, so that's what we're really talking about here)?\n\nI'll tell you why. Because PZ Meyers is as much a victim of conditioned, biased, unscientific thinking as the people he often rails against. The fact that he is most often right is an accident. He may be indoctrinated to a more accurate worldview, but he's still indoctrinated. \n\nCorporate entities are automatically the enemy. Little girls are automatically blameless victims. Parents of little girls are automatically well-meaning, but misguided. \n\nScientists are generally only scientific about their specialty. Outside that, they rarely if ever apply their disciplines of thought to the conclusions they form. \n\nPZ Meyers has no idea how many microscopes are bought by/for little girls, of what power, in what colour, and how this compares to the numbers for little boys. And not knowing the *what*, he *certainly* has no idea of the why. \n\nAnd yet, he has formed a clear opinion that something is wrong, that he knows what it is, and that he knows who is to blame. \n\nHe would not *dream* of leaping to conclusions in this fashion in biology, a field where he is a qualified expert. But he does so in psychology and sociology, fields where he is not. \n\nIt seems that the more ignorant someone is, the more cocksure they become.

A long time ago. Back when it was relevant.\n\n&gt; We deride people who are academically-inclined or educated, we praise the \"self-made man\" who made something of himself without the need for formal training, we call them nerds, book-worms.\nMy belief is that the anti-intellectualism stems from people not being entertained by what intellectuals think is \"cool\" -- like programming. They associate intellectuals with Shakespeare and Monet and wine tastings.\n\nI believe that part of the reason the self-made man is respected is because they have skills that are relevant -now- and can make a difference... -now-.\n\nTo understand how we got to this point, I need to give a small history lesson. Back in the 1800s, when the American education system was first sprouting up, the most PRESTIGIOUS career you could possibly have is a priest. That's why you went to school. No other reason why anyone would go to school. That's why you went to college. Actually, that's why most old-old colleges have a religious affiliation. Now, back then the only thing that was important to analyze was the Bible. \n\nAnd that was fine. If you wanted to become a priest. Then capitalism came in. Started saying, \"Hey, school/college is for everyone. So we're not just having you study the Bible, we're having you study Shakespeare too.\" and that was fine. For the 1700s. When there were no cars and no railroads, and generally no reason to learn problem solving, engineering, marketing, sales, or writing.\n\nWhile I love Shakespeare's writing and Claude Monet's painting, we should absolutely not be forcing that crap on our kids, masquerading it as \"teaching analytical skills\". What's more important? Learning to analyze Shakespeare, or learning to analyze modern social problems. Yes, I know, Shakespeare has some applications to modern social problems, no, I don't care. We've tried doing this shit the Shakespeare way since the 1700s. What's it done to the spirit and motivation of our students? It's crushed it. DOE performance audits (both internal and public) rate student motivation as it's lowest... ever.\n\nMy boss' original question is-- well, why is that? Here's the answer, and I'm right about this: it's because the stuff our students are learning is no longer relevant to their daily lives. At all.\n\nHere's something I learned the other day that simply blew me away-- one of my favorite Counter-Strike maps was, in fact, built by a fourteen year old. This kid apparently taught himself how to use it using online tutorials, and then practiced and practiced until something good came out. \n\nNow, if you can get a fourteen year-old kid to teach himself how to create a complicated map, while studying how gameplay flows inbetween the different areas, and successfully marketing it to a community, why isn't that kid being taught to do that in school? The CS thing is a perfect example, because it teaches marketing, analytics, critical thinking skills... all REALLY important. Yes, Shakespeare teaches critical thinking skills. I know. I don't care. Shakespeare is boring to *most* 14 year-old kids. CS is not.\n\n\n&gt; No, we don't value education, we don't value culture, we rejected everything the \"old world\" taught us \nYep. But screw the old world.\n\n&gt; threw the baby out with the bath-water, so now all we have left is an obscene culture of self-indulgence, self-gratification and self-obsession.\nYeah, pretty much hit the nail on the head. We need the education system fixed.\n\nMy first paying job was a Senate policy analyst. I specialized in education.","author_flair_css_class":null,"score":-3,"created_utc":"1262304386","downs":0,"archived":true,"parent_id":"t1_c0i0sj0","ups":-3,"link_id":"t3_akcbt","score_hidden":false,"gilded":0,"author":"[deleted]","subreddit":"politics","edited":true}

Have fun, be open minded, be relaxed, have a good date and you'll be fine.  Just like a bar, everyone puts their best foot forward on these sites, and so should you.  Just like a bar, sometimes you'll approach someone (online) and they'll turn you down.

The only thing that matters is if a decade (and by implication, century and millennium) starts on a year that ends with a 0 or ends with a 1. The general public usually *prefers* a 1, it's actually usually harder to convince people that counting should usually start at 0. If you look at a simple number table of 100 numbers, it usually is in rows of 10 starting at 1 and ending at 100. \n\nThis makes absolutely nothing harder for people, let alone computers. It's simply an issue of proper vocabulary.\n\nI've done years of C.S. and Math work, in and out of school. I like it when systems start counting from 0, and it irks me when they don't. But the simple fact is that we didn't do the right way originally, and changing our casual vocabulary to fit a slightly prettier system doesn't make sense to me.

{"id":"c0i13hz","controversiality":0,"body":"No it's not terminal. The issue is that she has arthritis throughout her body. Unfortunately it appears to bug her the most on the pad of her foot and as such she's licked it for the past year to help \"scratch\" the itch. As you know cat's tongues are like sandpaper, so she's essentially killed the tissue on her pad by licking it so much and has made a bloody mess of it. \n\nAs of a couple months ago I noticed she started to get a bit more agitated with it as she would actually gnaw at it trying to relieve the \"itch\" from the arthritis. When I looked closer it almost looked like she had punctured through to the bone. We had the vet take a look at it, but all he could do was give her some steroids to help with the itching but of course this is something he had to inject and it would only last a few days. So for months on end I would sterilize the wound, apply polysporin and wrap in gauze. After I wrapped it up, I even had to use hockey tape and tape it tightly to her foot otherwise she would tear off the bandage. I went about for a month or so changing the bandage every night, but at her age she doesn't appear to heal fast, if heal at all, so there was really no change. At this point we had the vet stitch it close, and since then she's been living with a cone on her head and limping around. I think she's doing better then she was months ago as it's obviously not bugging her as much, but she still try's to get at it which is why the cone is still on her head.\n\nWe all know she's nearing the end, and it will be the worst day of my life when we finally decide to put her down. It's not so much that the abcess is killing her, it's just causing her discomfort and pain, and I'd rather not have her live in that much pain.\n\nThanks for the hugs, I'll be sure to pass them onto my cat :P\nI do hope something miraculous happens with my cat, but only time will tell :)\n\nOnce again, hope your cat has many years left ahead :)","name":"t1_c0i13hz","retrieved_on":1426171572,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qh0u","author_flair_text":null,"ups":2,"archived":true,"downs":0,"parent_id":"t1_c0i130f","created_utc":"1262304846","score":2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"edited":true,"author":"Solor","subreddit":"pics","gilded":0,"score_hidden":false,"link_id":"t3_akcnr"}

A description of god and demonstrating the existence of a specific god is very different than demonstrating the existence of a god.\n\nNot only can I tell you firmly that god exists, because humans exist, and humans define the nature of the words they used, and we, or I more specifically have allowed the definition of god to include the abstract that which we cannot know but is more powerful than I and has some role in my creation, but also, I can show you that mathematically it is probabalistically much more likely for there to be some form of god than no god what-so-ever.\n\nIf you misunderstood my argument than fine, but I am not arguing that any one of your infinity of improbable things is true, all I am arguing is that taken as a whole, the likelihood of all of those improbable things, is greater than that of one other similarly improbable thing (no god). You give false value to your one improbable possible universe; all else being equal, and knowing nothing factual about the question of the existence of god, you give yourself a 50% chance of being true; a very narrow minded thing to do.

The church just let it sit there for years.  The easiest thing to say is probably that I didn't even know that thing existed.\n\nOne day I guess I off-handedly mentioned to my Grandparents that I really wanted a record player...\n\nWhen I walked into my bedroom that next fateful day, and saw what my simple request had bestowed upon me, I knew that I would never want another primary sound setup for the entire rest of my life.\n\n[The turntable I have](http://i.audioscope.net/sonyx55.jpg) was already in the ['69 Scott Berkeley from my grandparents](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2428/3728759630_576c106db3_o.jpg).  \n\nThe Berkeley, when I got it, was in perfect condition *but I've used it quite a lot since then*.

It's been through a lot since it met me, but I mean, I have plans to restore every aspect of that console when I can afford it in the future (I'm really not ever going to get rid of it.  Seriously.)  \n\nSo, I guess it's mostly for sentimental reasons, but I just can't imagine using a different turntable, because that PS-x55 has been doing a fine job for my family since the year it came out--  just like the stereo console that I got it in.\n\n","controversiality":0,"id":"c0i13m3"}
